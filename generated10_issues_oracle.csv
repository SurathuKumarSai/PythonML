"SSL initialization failed due to an expired certificate on the server, causing secure connections to be rejected.",High,Update the expired certificate with a new valid certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA). Restart the Directory Server after updating to ensure the new certificate is correctly loaded.
Unable to start Oracle Directory Server due to existing running process error (4612).,High,Stop the running server instance by checking the process and PID using system commands like 'ps -ef | grep ns-slapd' to find the already running process and kill it using 'kill -9 [PID]'. Ensure no Directory Server process is active before starting a new server instance. Review any scheduled tasks or cron jobs that might be causing unintended server startups.
Unable to start slapd because it is already running as process,Medium,"Check if there's an existing slapd process using the 'ps' command. If a duplicate server process is detected, stop the unwanted instance using the 'kill' command with the process ID. Ensure that no automatic scripts are attempting to start multiple instances on the same server."
Directory Server startup error with message ' cannot find user in system account database '. The server fails to start due to user identity issues.,High,Ensure the user specified in the Directory Server configuration exists in the system account database. Verify and modify the Directory Server configuration file to include an existing user account or add the required user in the system's account database and restart the server.
Replication Service Continues to Fail to Start,High,"Check the configuration of the replication agreement on both the supplier and consumer servers. Ensure that replication identities are properly defined and match on both ends. Restart the servers involved and, if the problem persists, disable and then re-enable replication, reassigning different replica IDs if necessary. Ensure that both supplier and consumer servers are running compatible versions of the replication protocol."
"Error 8293: A fatal problem occurred on the consumer side during replication with error logging 'consumer with error'. This can result in significant downtime and data inconsistency across distributed systems, impacting operations that rely on accurate directory information.",High,Investigate the specific error messages logged on the consumer side to identify the fault. Verify network stability and ensure the replication agreements are correctly configured. Restart both supplier and consumer servers to re-establish stable replication sessions. Apply any pending updates or patches to address the issue if it persists.
Replication halt caused by unsynchronized changes across DirectoryServer instances impacting data consistency.,High,"Perform a clean reinitialization of the affected replication topology. Start by identifying the master server with the latest data, export the data, and re-import this data to all other servers in the topology. Ensure sufficient system resources and verify no network issues exist. Restart the replication services and confirm synchronization using monitoring tools like 'insync'."
"During synchronization with Active Directory, the Directory Server receives an error due to mismatched hostnames between the server's SSL certificate and the configured hostname.",Medium,Verify that the hostname in the Identity Synchronization for Windows configuration matches the hostname embedded in the server's SSL certificate. Use the ldapsearch command to check the hostname on the certificate and update the configuration if necessary. Ensure that the SSL certificate is properly installed and that the connector is restarted after any changes.
SSL communication between the Directory Server and Active Directory Domain Controller fails. Error message: 'SSL_ForceHandshake failed'.,High,"Ensure both Directory Server and Active Directory certificates are correctly installed and valid. Verify that the SSL port is correctly set up on both ends, and check for any network issues or firewall blocks. Restart the involved services to apply changes."
Replication process between master and consumer servers is failing due to schema conflicts leading the consumer to reject updates.,High,"Ensure that the schema on both the master and consumer servers is consistent. Update the consumer server's schema to match the master by exporting the schema files from the master server and applying them to the consumer. If mismatch persists, consider reinitializing the entire replication chain after updating to ensure all replicas are consistent."
